## Current Objective: Purchase Handling Implemented

- Added Superwall listeners (`setSubscriptionStatusDidChangeHandler`, `setOnPurchaseHandler`, `setOnRestoreHandler`, `setOnDismissHandler`) in `lib/main.dart`.
- Basic logic included to print status changes and handle purchase/restore results.
- Relies on re-checking subscription status in `PackSelectionScreen` after purchase for granting access (user needs to tap again).

## Next Steps:

- Thorough testing of the purchase flow.
- Refine purchase handling logic based on specific app state management and desired user experience (e.g., automatic navigation after purchase).
- Configure paywalls and campaigns in the Superwall dashboard.
